## Options 

Options are a way to modify the behavior of a command, they can be:
- **[Global](#global-options)**, for all commands, see below.
- **Local**, only for a specific command, see the command help.

#### Command-line flags

- Entered as part of the CLI command.
- One-letter flags start with `-`, for example `-v`.
- Longer flags start with `--`, for example `--verbose`.
- **Flags take precedence over environment variables.**


#### Environment variables

- Each flag can be defined via an environment variable.
- Variable name is based on the flag name, and starts with `KBC_`.
- All letters are changed to uppercase and dashes to underscores.
- For example, flag `--log-file` can be defined by the `KBC_LOG_FILE` environment variable.
- Sources and priority of the environment variables:
    1. From the OS environment.
    2. From environment files in the working directory.
    3. From environment files in the project directory.

All found environment files are automatically loaded.  
Variables are merged together according to the following priority.

|---
| Environment File | Environment | Priority
|-|-|-
| `.env.development.local`  | Development | The highest |  
| `.env.test.local`         | Test |  |
| `.env.production.local`   | Production |  |
| `.env.local`              | Wherever the file is |  |
| `.env.development`        | Development|  |
| `.env.test`               | Test|  |
| `.env.production`         | Production|  |
| `.env`                    | All | The lowest  |

*Note: All `.*local` environment files should be part of the `.gitignore` file, if used.*

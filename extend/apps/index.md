Data Apps are simple web apps used to work with data and have an easy to use, accessible UI that enables data-driven decision making.

They could be written in any language, but for starters we want to support [Streamlit language](https://streamlit.io/), which enables rapid development of these apps.

To understand how the applications communicate to your application go to the [proxy](/extend/apps/proxy/) page.

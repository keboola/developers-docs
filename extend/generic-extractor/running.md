Generic Extractor is normally run from within the Keboola user interface. It can be found in the **Extractors** section
and all you need to do is provide its configuration JSON. No other settings are necessary.

Because creating the configuration JSON can be a non-trivial task, there are some things which can help
you in developing the configuration.

## Debug Mode
Debug mode can be turned on by setting `"debug": true` in the `config` section of the configuration, e.g.:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "api": {
        ...
    },
    "config": {
        "debug": true,
        ...
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In debug mode, the extractor displays all API requests it sends, helping you understand what is really happening,
why something is skipped, etc.

**Warning:** If the API sends sensitive data (e.g. authorization token) in the URL, these may become
visible in the events. Also, debug mode considerably slows the extraction. Therefore it should never
be turned on in production configurations.

## Running Locally
If you are working on a complicated configuration, or developing a new component based on
Generic Extractor, running every configuration from the Keboola UI may be slow and tedious.
You may run Generic Extractor locally, provided that you have access to [Docker](/extend/component/docker-tutorial/).
The following is **not necessary** to run or configure Generic Extractor in Keboola.

### Run Built Version
Create an empty directory somewhere and in it create a `config.json` file with a
configuration you want to execute. For example:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "parameters": {
    "api": {
      "baseUrl": "https://api.github.com",
      "http": {
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Content-Type": "application/json;charset=UTF-8"
      }
    },
    "config": {
      "debug": true,
      "jobs": [
        {
          "endpoint": "/orgs/keboola/members",
          "dataType": "members"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then run Generic Extractor in the current directory by executing the following command on *nix systems:

    docker run -v ($pwd):/data quay.io/keboola/generic-extractor:latest

or on Windows:

    docker run -v %cd%:/data quay.io/keboola/generic-extractor:latest

You should see:

    DEBUG: Using NO Auth [] []
    DEBUG: Using automatic conversion of single values to arrays where required. [] []
    DEBUG: GET /orgs/keboola/members HTTP/1.1 Host: api.github.com User-Agent: Guzzle/5.3.1 curl/7.38.0 PHP/7.0.17   [] []
    DEBUG: Analyzing members {"rowsAnalyzed":[],"rowsToAnalyze":7} []
    DEBUG: Processing results for __kbc_default. [] []
    INFO: Extractor finished successfully. [] []

along with the output tables created in `/out/tables` sub-directory of the current directory.
It is recommended to remove the contents of the `out/tables` directory before running the extractor again.

**Important:** Generic Extractor itself is not able to decrypt encrypted values. That means that when you
supply the configuration directly in the `config.json` file, you must always provide decrypted values --- e.g.:

{% highlight json %}
{
    ...,
    "config": {
        "#username": "JohnDoe",
        "#password": "TopSecret",
        ...
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

When you store such configuration in the Keboola UI, it will automatically be encrypted:

{% highlight json %}
{
    ...,
    "config": {
        "#username": "JohnDoe",
        "#password": "KBC::ComponentProjectEncrypted==r13Khq0lR4ycDNTujirz5/GMqNEVZ4tZ2OTmRcsNYqlP/a/STMelWtz9R8yEtr3ck6KiYA7XrL8pqIQv9S7Ro28KNZgmqtSNzKhFcEsItPnTDCQqvnU99q2a0ES+oN/v",
        ...
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The above configuration then **cannot** be run locally.

### Building and Running the Image
To build the container from source:

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/keboola/generic-extractor.git`.
- Switch to the created directory: `cd generic-extractor`.
- Build the container: `docker-compose build`.
- Install dependencies locally: `docker-compose run --rm extractor composer install`.
- Create a **data folder** for configuration: `mkdir data`.

To run the built container:

- Create a configuration file `config.json` in the **data folder**.
- Run the extraction: `docker-compose run --rm extractor`.
- You will find the extracted data in the `out/tables` sub-directory of the **data folder**.

Before running the extractor again, it is recommended to clear the `out` directory by
running `docker-compose run --rm extractor rm -rf data/out`.

## Running Examples
[All examples](https://github.com/keboola/generic-extractor/tree/master/doc) referenced in this documentation are actually runnable against the proper API. Because
it is difficult to find the specific API for the case (and gain access to it), you can test
these configurations against a [mock server](https://github.com/keboola/ex-generic-mock-server).
Each example contains a set of requests (`*.request` file) and responses (`*.response`) and
optionally their headers (`*.requestHeaders` and `*.responseHeaders`).

To run the examples:

- Clone Generic Extractor repository: `git clone https://github.com/keboola/generic-extractor.git`.
- Navigate to the documentation directory: `cd generic-extractor/doc`.
- Run a single example of your choice, e.g.: `docker-compose run -e "KBC_EXAMPLE_NAME=001-simple-job" extractor`.
- The output will be available in `examples/001-simple-job/out/tables`.
- Or run all examples by executing `./run-samples.sh`.

If you want to create your own example, follow the instructions in the [mock server repository](https://github.com/keboola/ex-generic-mock-server/blob/master/README.md#creating-examples).

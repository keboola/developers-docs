Extracting data incrementally is universally beneficial --- it speeds up the extraction and lowers the load on both the API and
[KBC Storage](https://help.keboola.com/storage/) (thus saving 
[credits](https://help.keboola.com/management/limits/#project-power)).

## Options
After you have incrementally extracted data from an API, the data must be [incrementally loaded](https://help.keboola.com/storage/tables/#incremental-loading)
into Storage. To do that, simply set `"incrementalOutput": true` in the `config` section. 

There are, however, a number of implications in the incremental loads. It essentially boils downs to the following use cases, 
depending on what kind of data you are importing (extracting from an API):

- The imported data contain only **added entries**. When `incrementalOutput` is turned on, the data will be simply appended to the 
target table in Storage. Turning `incrementalOutput` to false probably makes no sense because the table will contain only the new entries.
- The imported data contain **added and modified entries**. When `incrementalOutput` is turned on, set a primary key on the table 
so that new rows are added and existing [rows are updated](https://help.keboola.com/storage/tables/#primary-key-deduplication). 
If the primary key is not set, the modified entries will be duplicated in the target table. Turning `incrementalOutput` to false 
probably makes no sense because the table will contain only the new entries.
- The imported data contain **all rows**. In this case, set a primary key for the table or turn `incrementalOutput` to false. Turning 
`incrementalOutput` to true probably makes no sense because the table will contain duplicate entries. If you set the primary key, new 
rows will be added and modified rows will be updated. Note that in this case more 
[credits](https://help.keboola.com/management/limits/#project-power) are consumed.

In neither of these situations will the missing rows get deleted. If you want to do so, the only way is 
to turn `incrementalOutput` to false and do full loads. 

Using incremental loads obviously requires some support from the API. Generic Extractor supports incremental 
loads by using [`previousStart`](/extend/generic-extractor/functions/#parameters-context) and the
[`time` function](/extend/generic-extractor/functions/#time). Setting the primary key is done using
[mappings](/extend/generic-extractor/config/mappings/).

## Examples

### Previous Start Example
Assume you have an API supporting a parameter `modified_since` which expects a 
[Unix Timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). The response then contains only the 
records that were modified after the specified date. The following configuration can be used:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "config": {
        "incrementalOutput": true,
        "outputBucket": "mock-server",
        "jobs": [
            {
                "endpoint": "users",
                "dataType": "users",
                "params": {
                    "modified_since": {
                        "time": "previousStart"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The configuration adds the `modified_since` parameter as a reference to the internal 
[`time.previousStart` value](/extend/generic-extractor/functions/#parameters-context), which contains the timestamp of the last 
**successful start** of the extraction of the particular configuration. The request generated by this configuration is something like:

    GET /users?modified_since=1492606006

where `1492606006` is the variable timestamp of the last successful start. This introduces state into the
Generic Extractor configuration as it now remembers when it last successfully ran. This means 
that if you run the above configuration every five minutes, it will extract the data modified within the last five minutes. 
If you run it every hour, it will extract the data modified within the last hour. 

Should one of the runs fail or be skipped for any reason, the extraction will pick up where it ended the last time it was successful. 
See [example [EX107]](https://github.com/keboola/generic-extractor/tree/master/doc/examples/107-incremental-load).

The last successful time is stored in the [configuration state](/extend/common-interface/config-file/#state-file).
If for some reason you need to reset it, 
[update the configuration via API](http://docs.keboola.apiary.io/#reference/component-configurations/manage-configurations/update-configuration).

### Previous Start Date
If an API similar to the one in the [above example](#previous-start-example) requires the date to be 
sent as a string, the following jobs configuration (which uses the [`date` function](/extend/generic-extractor/functions/#date))
can be used:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "jobs": [
        {
            "endpoint": "users",
            "dataType": "users",
            "params": {
                "modified_since": {
                    "function": "date",
                    "args": [
                        "Y-m-d H:i:s",
                        {
                            "time": "previousStart"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

This sends a request like:

    GET /users?modified_since=2017-04-19%2012%3A46%3A46

in a more readable [url-decoded](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/) form:

	GET /users?modified_since=2017-04-19 12:46:46

Otherwise the configuration behaves the same way as the [previous example](#previous-start-example).

See [example [EX108]](https://github.com/keboola/generic-extractor/tree/master/doc/examples/108-incremental-load-date).

### Incremental Load From To
Another option is an API which requires the `from` and `to` parameters. The following
configuration generates the `from` date as the date of the last extraction (using the [`time.previousStart` 
value](/extend/generic-extractor/functions/#parameters-context)). It also generates the `to` date as the date 
of the current extraction (using the [`time.currentStart` value](/extend/generic-extractor/functions/#parameters-context)):

{% highlight json %}
{
    "jobs": [
        {
            "endpoint": "users",
            "dataType": "users",
            "params": {
                "from": {
                    "function": "date",
                    "args": [
                        "Y-m-d",
                        {
                            "time": "previousStart"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "to": {
                    "function": "date",
                    "args": [
                        "Y-m-d",
                        {
                            "time": "currentStart"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

This configuration will send a request similar to this one:

    GET /109-incremental-load-from-to/users?from=2017-04-19&to=2017-04-24

See [example [EX109]](https://github.com/keboola/generic-extractor/tree/master/doc/examples/109-incremental-load-from-to).

### Incremental Relative Load
Suppose you have an API supporting the `from` and `to` parameters as in [the above example](#incremental-load-from-to) and 
want to extract the last day data. It can be done using the following configuration:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "jobs": [
        {
            "endpoint": "users",
            "dataType": "users",
            "params": {
                "from": {
                    "function": "date",
                    "args": [
                        "Y-m-d",
                        {
                            "function": "strtotime",
                            "args": [
                                "-1 day",
                                {
                                    "time": "currentStart"
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "to": {
                    "function": "date",
                    "args": [
                        "Y-m-d",
                        {
                            "time": "currentStart"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

This configuration leads to a request similar to this one:

    GET /110-incremental-relative/users?from=2017-04-23&to=2017-04-24

Remember, this is not a truly reliable incremental load. If you put such configuration 
into an orchestration, and the configuration does not run for some reason, you may miss some data. 
However, this may still be a useful approach for obtaining samples of data for POCs.

title: Manifest Files Specification

---

A manifest file contains additional information about tables and files injected to the
[`/data/in` folders](/extend/common-interface/folders/).
It also provides a way to specify options for tables and files transferred back to Storage from `/data/out`
folders. Manifest files have the `.manifest` suffix to the original file.

All files in `/data/in` have the manifest file generated by us. For files generated by your code
in `/data/out`, the manifest file **is optional**. Also, keep in mind that all manifests have a lower priority
than input and output mapping.

## Format

The format of the manifest file is always *JSON*. The manifest
file always has the `.manifest` extension. This applies to files with multiple extensions as well, so the following
filenames are expected:

| Data File Name | Manifest File Name       |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| myfile         | myfile.manifest          |
| myfile.csv     | myfile.csv.manifest      |
| myfile.csv.gz  | myfile.csv.gz.manifest   |

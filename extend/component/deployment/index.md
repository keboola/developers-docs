If you created your component according to the [tutorial](/extend/component/tutorial/), you already have
a deployment pipeline set up. This article explains in more detail how the pipeline works. It also describes
alternative set ups. Assuming your component is similar to the [example component](https://github.com/keboola/ex-docs-tutorial)
created in the [tutorial](/extend/component/tutorial/), you see the following behavior:

- Every commit & push to the git repository triggers a build on [Travis](https://docs.travis-ci.com/).
- Every new tag pushes the built image into our [AWS ECR registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).
- Every [normal version tag](https://semver.org/#spec-item-2) (x.y.z) updates the image tag in the [Developer Portal](https://components.keboola.com/) and subsequently makes the image available in Keboola.

We highly recommend the above setup (or a similar one) as it imposes very little extra work on the developer, yet
it deploys new versions of the component in a controlled and traceable manner.

## How It Works
The following text explains the default setup in detail so that you know what to do if something
breaks or how to set up the pipeline manually.

### Integration
The first step is the integration between GitHub and Travis. This is best set from the Travis side
by enabling the repository:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Add Repository](/extend/component/deployment/deploy-config-1.png)

Enable builds for the repository. If you don't see the repository, use the **Sync account** button:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Enable Travis Repository](/extend/component/deployment/deploy-config-2.png)

This causes Travis to trigger a build on every GitHub commit & push.

### Build Setting
What the Travis build does is defined in the
[`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/keboola/component-generator/blob/master/templates-common/.travis.yml) file in
your repository. You should have something similar to this:

{% highlight yaml %}
sudo: required
language: bash
services:
  - docker

before_script:
  - export APP_IMAGE=keboola-component
  - docker build . --tag=$APP_IMAGE

after_success:
  - docker images

deploy:
  provider: script
  skip_cleanup: true
  script: ./deploy.sh
  on:
    tags: true
{% endhighlight %}

The `.travis.yml` file offers a vast number of [configuration options](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/).
We only need a few of them though. The options `sudo`, `language` and `services` define that all we need is Docker.
The `before_script` section executes a single shell command which
[builds the image](/extend/component/tutorial/debugging/#step-2--build-the-image) and tags it `keboola-component`. The
tag is completely arbitrary at this moment, but we'll need it later. The `after_success` section simply lists the
built images in the log.

The `deploy` section defines when a deploy will be triggered (`on tags`) and what should be done `deploy.sh`. This means that
when Travis encounters a tagged commit, it triggers the `deploy.sh` shell script (after everything else was done).

### Deploy Script
In your repository, you should have a [deploy script](https://github.com/keboola/component-generator/blob/master/templates-common/deploy.sh)
similar to the one below:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Obtain the component repository and log in
docker pull quay.io/keboola/developer-portal-cli-v2:latest
export REPOSITORY=`docker run --rm  \
    -e KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_USERNAME \
    -e KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_PASSWORD \
    quay.io/keboola/developer-portal-cli-v2:latest \
    ecr:get-repository ${KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_VENDOR} ${KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_APP}`
eval $(docker run --rm \
    -e KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_USERNAME \
    -e KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_PASSWORD \
    quay.io/keboola/developer-portal-cli-v2:latest \
    ecr:get-login ${KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_VENDOR} ${KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_APP})

# Push to the repository
docker tag ${APP_IMAGE}:latest ${REPOSITORY}:${TRAVIS_TAG}
docker tag ${APP_IMAGE}:latest ${REPOSITORY}:latest
docker push ${REPOSITORY}:${TRAVIS_TAG}
docker push ${REPOSITORY}:latest

# Update the tag in Keboola Developer Portal -> Deploy to Keboola
if echo ${TRAVIS_TAG} | grep -c '^v\?[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+$'
then
    docker run --rm \
        -e KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_USERNAME \
        -e KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_PASSWORD \
        quay.io/keboola/developer-portal-cli-v2:latest \
        update-app-repository ${KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_VENDOR} ${KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_APP} ${TRAVIS_TAG} ecr ${REPOSITORY}
else
    echo "Skipping deployment to KBC, tag ${TRAVIS_TAG} is not allowed."
fi
{% endhighlight %}

The script uses our [Developer Portal CLI tool](https://github.com/keboola/developer-portal-cli-v2) to communicate with
the [Developer Portal API](https://kebooladeveloperportal.docs.apiary.io/#). The tool itself is provided as a Docker
image `quay.io/keboola/developer-portal-cli-v2`. The entire script uses the following environment variables:

- `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_USERNAME` -- Service account user name
- `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_PASSWORD` -- Service account password
- `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_VENDOR` -- Vendor ID
- `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_APP` -- Component ID

You can read more about using the Developer Portal CLI in the [chapter about running components](/extend/component/running/#running-a-component).
The deploy script first pulls the image and then calls the `ecr:get-repository` command (while passing in the
`KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_USERNAME` and `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_PASSWORD` variables). The result of that command is stored in the `REPOSITORY`
variable. After that the `ecr:get-login` command is called; it returns
a command line to authorize against our AWS ECR registry (e.g `docker login -u AWS -p ey...ODAzOH0=
147946154733.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`). The return value is `eval`ed -- i.e., the login command is executed.

Then there are two `docker tag` and `docker push` commands which tag the image build as `keboola-component` with the `latest` tag
and the git commit tag (stored in `TRAVIS_TAG` variable). Push the two resulting images into the AWS ECR registry.

The last part of the script begins with a check that the commit tag (`TRAVIS_TAG`) is a [normal version tag](https://semver.org/#spec-item-2)
(`x.y.z`). If not, the component is not updated in the Developer Portal. However, at this stage the image was already pushed into the registry
so it can be used by [running it explicitly](/extend/component/tutorial/debugging/#running-specific-tags). If the git tag
is a normal version tag, the component is updated in the Developer Portal using the `update-app-repository` command.
This means that the new version of the component is immediately deployed into Keboola. Keep in mind that it takes a couple of minutes
to propagate the change to all Keboola instances.

When modifying the deploy script, make sure the `deploy.sh` file line ending is set to **Unix (LF)**. Also make sure that the file is executable,
i.e., by executing `git update-index --chmod=+x deploy.sh`. If the script is not executable, you'll get the following error message:

	Script failed with status 127

or

  bash: ./deploy.sh: Permission denied


### Deploy Configuration
The above deploy script requires four environment variables to be set. Set the following environment variables in the repository configuration:

 - `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_APP` the component ID -- e.g.: `keboola-test.ex-docs-tutorial`
 - `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_PASSWORD` with the [**Service Account**](/extend/component/tutorial/#creating-a-deployment-account) password
 - `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_USERNAME` with the [**Service Account**](/extend/component/tutorial/#creating-a-deployment-account) login
 - `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_VENDOR` with the vendor of the component -- e.g.: `keboola-test`

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Repository Configuration](/extend/component/deployment/deploy-config-3.png)

### Trigger Build
Commit and push anything to the repository to trigger the build. In Travis, you should see an output similar to this:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Build Log](/extend/component/deployment/deploy-log-1.png)

Now push a tag to the repository (we recommend using [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)):

    git tag 0.0.6
    git push origin --tags

In Travis, you should see an output similar to this:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Build and Deploy Log](/extend/component/deployment/deploy-log-2.png)

If no errors occurred, the component is now deployed into Keboola. In the Developer Portal, you can verify that the
component repository and tag were automatically set:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Deploy Verification](/extend/component/deployment/deploy-final.png)

The component is now runnable in Keboola. You can view all settings in our
[example repository](https://github.com/keboola/ex-docs-tutorial). You can also
review [Travis Configuration](https://travis-ci.org/keboola/ex-docs-tutorial/).

*Note that it takes up to **5 minutes** before the changes in the Developer Portal propagate to all Keboola instances in all regions.*

## Bitbucket Integration
The [development tutorial](/extend/component/tutorial/) as well as the above description assume you're using
Travis CI Service for building and deploying the image. Travis integrates very well with [GitHub](https://github.com/), but not with
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/). However, Bitbucket has its own continuous integration service --
[Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines).

You have to enable Bitbucket Pipelines in your repository:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Bitbucket Pipelines](/extend/component/deployment/bitbucket-1.png)

Note that only the owner of the repository can enable pipelines. Then set the environment variables in settings:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Bitbucket Environment Variables](/extend/component/deployment/bitbucket-2.png)

Add the following [`bitbucket-pipelines.yml`](https://github.com/keboola/component-generator/blob/master/templates/bitbucket-deploy/bitbucket-pipelines.yml) file to your repository:

{% highlight yaml %}
options:
  docker: true

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        script:
          - export APP_IMAGE=keboola-component
          - docker build . --tag=$APP_IMAGE
          - docker images

  tags:
    '*':
      - step:
          script:
          - export APP_IMAGE=keboola-component
          - docker build . --tag=$APP_IMAGE
          - docker images
          - ./deploy.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Also add the [`deploy.sh` script](https://github.com/keboola/component-generator/blob/master/templates/bitbucket-deploy/deploy.sh),
which is modified to use the [`BITBUCKET_TAG`](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/environment-variables-794502608.html) variable (instead of `TRAVIS_TAG`). When done, commit and push; a build will automatically appear in the **Pipelines** section:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Bitbucket Build](/extend/component/deployment/bitbucket-3.png)

With the above settings, the Bitbucket Pipelines will behave in exactly the same way as the Travis configuration described above.
You can also have a look at a [10 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf_hfM_zNyU) showing the Bitbucket setup on a new component.

## GitLab Integration
The [development tutorial](/extend/component/tutorial/) as well as the above description assume you're using
Travis CI Service for building and deploying the image. Travis integrates very well with [GitHub](https://github.com/), but not with
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). However, GitLab has its own continuous integration service --
[CI Pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines.html).

You have to set the environment variables in settings:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- GitLab Environment Variables](/extend/component/deployment/gitlab-1.png)

Then add the following [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://github.com/keboola/component-generator/blob/master/templates/gitlab-deploy/.gitlab-ci.yml) file to your repository:

{% highlight yaml %}
image: docker:latest

variables:
  DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
  APP_IMAGE: keboola-component

services:
- docker:dind

before_script:
- docker info

build-component:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build . --tag=$APP_IMAGE

deploy-component:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - docker build . --tag=$APP_IMAGE
    - pwd
    - ls -la
    - export
    - ./deploy.sh
  only:
    - tags
{% endhighlight %}

Also add the [`deploy.sh` script](https://github.com/keboola/component-generator/blob/master/templates/gitlab-deploy/deploy.sh),
which is modified to use the [`CI_COMMIT_TAG`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/variables/README.html) (instead of `TRAVIS_TAG`) and use `sh` shell (instead of `bash`). When done, commit and push; a build will automatically appear in the **Pipelines** section:

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- GitLab Build](/extend/component/deployment/gitlab-2.png)

With the above settings, the GitLab CI Pipelines will behave in exactly the same way as the Travis configuration described above.
You can also have a look at a [10 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC-tN-zYgEw) showing the GitLab setup on a new component.

## Manual Deployment
If you want to use another continuous integration setting or deploy to the repository manually, you can do so without limitations.
As in the [above script](/extend/component/deployment/#deploy-script),
we recommend using the [Developer Portal CLI client](https://github.com/keboola/developer-portal-cli-v2). This CLI tool (runnable in Docker or PHP)
allows you to obtain the repository for a component and push credentials to that repository. See the chapter about
[running components](/extend/component/running/#running-a-component), for example, how to obtain the AWS registry credentials.
If you want to get even more low level, you can use the [Developer Portal API](https://kebooladeveloperportal.docs.apiary.io/#) directly.
It also allows you to [generate credentials for a service account](https://kebooladeveloperportal.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/vendor/create-service-account)
programmatically. We use our AWS ECR registry for hosting all component images.

## Test Live Configurations
Testing your component can be simply added as part of the script in `.travis.yml` file. See an example in
[Python](https://github.com/keboola/component-generator/blob/master/templates/python-tests/.travis.yml) or
[PHP](https://github.com/keboola/component-generator/blob/master/templates/php-component/.travis.yml).

However, you may want to test the component on some 'real' configurations
in your project. You can do this by extending the build script and adding certain environment variables to
Travis with an appropriate [Storage token](https://help.keboola.com/storage/tokens/)
and configuration ID. It is highly recommended to create a dedicated token for this task.

The commands will need two extra environment variables apart from the
[ones listed above](/extend/component/deployment/#deploy-configuration):

- `KBC_STORAGE_TOKEN` --- the Storage token that the test(s) will run under
- `KBC_APP_TEST_CONFIG` --- the ID of the configuration to test

{: .image-popup}
![Screenshot -- Sample Configurations](/extend/component/deployment/configuration-sample.png)

If you are still using our [sample component code](https://github.com/keboola/ex-docs-tutorial),
create a configuration and set an arbitrary table on input.

The following extended `.travis.yml` will do the trick:

{% highlight yaml %}
sudo: false

services:
  - docker

before_script:
  - export APP_IMAGE=keboola-component
  - docker build -t $APP_IMAGE .
  - docker run $APP_IMAGE flake8
  - docker run $APP_IMAGE python -m unittest discover
  # push test image to ECR
  - docker pull quay.io/keboola/developer-portal-cli-v2:latest
  - export REPOSITORY=`docker run --rm -e KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_USERNAME -e KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_PASSWORD -e KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_URL quay.io/keboola/developer-portal-cli-v2:latest ecr:get-repository $KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_VENDOR $KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_APP`
  - docker tag $APP_IMAGE:latest $REPOSITORY:test
  - eval $(docker run --rm -e KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_USERNAME -e KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_PASSWORD -e KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_URL quay.io/keboola/developer-portal-cli-v2:latest ecr:get-login $KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_VENDOR $KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_APP)
  - docker push $REPOSITORY:test
  - docker pull quay.io/keboola/syrup-cli:latest

script:
  - docker run --rm -e KBC_STORAGE_TOKEN quay.io/keboola/syrup-cli:latest run-job $KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_APP $KBC_APP_TEST_CONFIG test

after_success:
  - docker images

deploy:
  provider: script
  skip_cleanup: true
  script: "./deploy.sh"
  on:
    tags: true
{% endhighlight %}

The commands above

- build the component image and tag it `keboola-component`.
- run the [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) code style check.
- run [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/unittest.html) tests.
- pull the [Developer Portal CLI client](https://github.com/keboola/developer-portal-cli-v2).
- get the component's Keboola registry from the Developer Portal and store it in the `REPOSITORY` variable.
- tag the image as `test`.
- get the command to login to the registry (`ecr:get-login`) and execute it (i.e., log in).
- push the image to the registry.
- pull the job runner CLI client ([Syrup PHP CLI](https://github.com/keboola/syrup-php-cli)).
- run the specified test job on Keboola using the `/{component}/{config}/run/tag/{tag}` -- [Keboola Docker API](https://kebooladocker.docs.apiary.io/#reference/run/create-a-job-with-image/run-job). The tag used is `test`.

If you want to run multiple test jobs, simply repeat the command with the different configuration IDs
that you would like to test.

When you commit to the component repository, the Docker image will be built, and using a `test` tag, it will be tested in production Keboola.
However, it will not be deployed to production! To get it into production, create a new normal version tag (`x.y.z`) in the repository.
The Docker image will be built and tested using the `test` tag, and if all succeeds, it will be deployed
with the `x.y.z` tag into Keboola --- a new version will be available in production.
You can see the [Python code](https://github.com/keboola/component-generator/tree/master/templates/python-tests) or
[PHP code](https://github.com/keboola/component-generator/tree/master/templates/php-component/) in our
[Templates repository](https://github.com/keboola/component-generator/tree/master/templates)
or in our [Docker Demo App](https://github.com/keboola/docker-demo-app) GitHub repository.

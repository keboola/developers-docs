In this part of the [tutorial](/extend/component/tutorial/), you will see how to use **input mapping**. Input mapping
defines what data your component receives from the end users' project. A component never
operates on data in a project's [Storage](https://help.keboola.com/storage/),
it always receives a copy of the selected data.

Input mapping is therefore used when your component needs to read data from the customer
project -- these are typically **writers** and **applications**. Implementing the input mapping requires three steps:

- adding input mapping to the component UI
- adding input mapping to the component source code
- verifying

## Adding Input Mapping to UI
Adding the input mapping to the component UI is very simple. In the [Developer Portal](https://components.keboola.com/), edit the component
and add `genericDockerUI-tableInput` or `genericDockerUI-fileInput` (or both) [UI options](/extend/component/ui-options/).

Save the changes, and the corresponding UI elements will appear in your component configuration. Keep in mind that the changes
take up to 5 minutes to propagate to all Keboola instances.

## Modifying Source Code
You also need to modify the source code so that it works with the input data. The data from input mapping will be available in the
[`/data/in/tables/`](/extend/common-interface/folders/#folder-dataintables) and
[`/data/in/files`](/extend/common-interface/folders/#folder-datainfiles) folders when the component is
[run](/extend/docker-runner/). This is almost identical to writing
[Transformation code](https://help.keboola.com/manipulation/transformations/) -- the only difference is that you need to
use absolute paths (or the [`KBC_DATADIR`](/extend/common-interface/environment/#environment-variables) environment variable).

Therefore you can modify the [example component](/extend/component/tutorial/) code to, for instance, the
[following one](https://github.com/keboola/ex-docs-tutorial), which works with table input mapping.

{% highlight python %}
import csv

print("Hello, World! from python")

csvlt = '\n'
csvdel = ','
csvquo = '"'
with open('/data/in/tables/source.csv', mode='rt', encoding='utf-8') as in_file:
    lazy_lines = (line.replace('\0', '') for line in in_file)
    reader = csv.DictReader(lazy_lines, lineterminator=csvlt, delimiter=csvdel, quotechar=csvquo)
    for row in reader:
        # do something
        print("The first row is ", row)
        # we don't want to print the entire file to the output
        exit()

{% endhighlight %}

Commit and push the code in your repository, and tag it with a [normal version tag](https://semver.org/#spec-item-2).
This will trigger a [build on Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) and automatically
deploy the new version into Keboola. Keep in mind that after the deployment, it may take up to 5 minutes for the update to propagate to all Keboola instances.

## Verifying
If you configured the UI correctly, you should see the corresponding control in the component
configuration page.

Add a **New Table Input**, select an arbitrary table from the project, and make sure to set **Destination** to `source.csv`
so that the final path matches `/data/in/tables/source.csv`, which is what you are expecting in the code.

Now run the component and you should see the proper message in job events.

## Summary
Your component can now successfully read a provided table. You can learn
more about other input mapping options in the
[data folder specification](/extend/common-interface/folders/). Also, the
[manifest files](/extend/common-interface/manifest-files/) contain metadata which
might be useful in your component. The next part of the tutorial will show you
how to create [output mapping](/extend/component/tutorial/output-mapping/).
